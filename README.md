In this project there are 2 frameworks, one which is TS with playwright wrapped in cucumber, the second is just a simple TS and playwright framework
Each framework has it's own readme.
You will need to put the app folder at the same level as the 2 frameworks or change the path to be absolute. 
I have also included a ps script for installing the electron app on a VM.

My manual scripts are written in the feature files located in the cucumber framework.

Reasoning:
In both the interviews i spoke about how i believe cucumber to be a very powerful tool for testing and acceptance criteria for stories so i wanted to show how the framework would work and the benefits of it. 
The TS and playwright framework is the initial brief so wanted to ensure the condition was met.
